# Conclusion
In conclusion, this thesis has introduced hwdbg, a new hardware debugger that brings software debugging paradigms to hardware debugging. Through extensive development, implementation, and evaluation,  hwdbg has shown to be a unique and powerful tool for advancing electronic system development.

The research presented in this thesis has made several contributions to the field of hardware debugging. Firstly, hwdbg introduces a unified debugging framework that leverages software debugging concepts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware debugging processes.

Moreover,  hwdbg's integration with FPGAs opens new possibilities for real-time debugging and IP core testing. It is synthesizable into Xilinx FPGAs and provides hardware engineers with a practical solution for debugging high-frequency signals and complex hardware designs. Additionally,  hwdbg is open-source and customizable, so it can be modified based on users' specific needs. Furthermore,  hwdbg's capabilities extend beyond traditional hardware debugging tasks. It supports signal manipulation, fault injection, chip fuzzing, and enhances reverse engineering, enabling researchers to uncover possible vulnerabilities to ensure the robustness of hardware systems.

Finally, the development and implementation of hwdbg represent a significant milestone in the evolution of hardware debugging technologies. As electronic systems continue to grow in complexity,  hwdbg stands as a useful tool to address the challenges and opportunities of the hardware development landscape.

# Future Works

The future development of the hwdbg hardware debugger offers numerous exciting possibilities aimed at enhancing its capabilities and expanding its applicability. As an enhancement, cross-platform compatibility and integration with various FPGA and SoC environments could be added. Extending support for additional hardware platforms would make hwdbg more accessible to a broader range of developers and engineers.  Furthermore, hwdbg could support different protocols for fuzzing, such as Wishbone, AXI, AMBA, Avalon, and others. This enhancement would significantly broaden the scope of its applicability, allowing it to be used in a wider variety of hardware systems and interfaces. Supporting these protocols would enable hwdbg to test and debug systems that use different communication standards, making it a better tool for security researchers.

To support higher speeds and improve performance, exploring the possibility of fabricating hwdbg into dedicated chips is another potential future direction. By moving from an FPGA-based implementation to a custom chip, hwdbg could achieve faster processing times, lower power consumption, and higher reliability. This transition could make it suitable for high-speed applications and environments where performance is critical.
