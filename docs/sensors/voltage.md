# Voltage Sensor

Voltage sensors monitor the voltage levels within a hardware system, providing data for maintaining optimal operation and preventing damage from overvoltage or undervoltage conditions. 

The usage of these sensors is also integrated in hwdbg to provide researchers with further details about the internals of a microchip or an IP core.
