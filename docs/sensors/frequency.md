# Frequency Sensor

Frequency sensors measure the operating frequency of hardware components, which ensures that they function within specified parameters. Accurate frequency measurement is essential for verifying clock signals and maintaining synchronization across the system.

Frequency sensors detect the frequency of oscillating signals by counting the number of cycles within a specific time period. This data is then processed to determine the operating frequency accurately. These sensors are also another source of data for analyzing the internal condition of debuggee.
