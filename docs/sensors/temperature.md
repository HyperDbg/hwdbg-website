# Temperature sensor

As their name implies, temperature sensors provide details about the thermal state of hardware components, and thermal stability. 

Temperature sensors are integrated into the hardware debugger to provide continuous thermal monitoring. In hardware debugging, they help identify thermal hotspots and enable dynamic thermal management strategies to possibly leak data from the target debuggee.
