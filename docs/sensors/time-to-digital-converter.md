# Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC)

A Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) measures time intervals with high precision by converting the time difference between two events into a digital value. 

TDSs are implemented as debugging modules and integrated with hwdbg to provide accurate results about the occurrence of events in the system.
