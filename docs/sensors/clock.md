# Clock Sensor

Clock sensors monitor and verify clock signals within a hardware system. Accurate clock signals are critical for timing and synchronization, and clock sensors help ensure that these signals remain within specified tolerances.

Clock sensors utilize techniques such as phase-locked loops (PLLs) and clock distribution networks to monitor clock frequencies and phases. These techniques help detect discrepancies and maintain synchronization across the system. These sensors are also another source of data for hwdbg.
