# Comments

hwdbg's comments are like C comments. A comment starts with a slash asterisk `/*` and ends with an asterisk slash `*/` and can be anywhere in your program. Comments can span several lines within your C program.


```
/* comment goes here */
```

OR

```
/*
 * comment goes here
 */
```

You can create a comment on a single line.

```
// comment goes here
```
